        <p>The horse Jump is a movement trick in DMC that allows the player to instantly gain required currency to open the red door.
            Run straight down the middle of the staircase, do a half tap jump then a full hold jump to get on the horse. Turn towards the spear and then do a stationary wall hike.
            Do not move the stick because dante will move forward on his own.</p>
