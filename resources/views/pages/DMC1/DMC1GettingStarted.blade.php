            {{"Before you consider speedrunning, you want to be quite familiar with the game, its mechanics and the mission layouts.
            It's not recommended to start after only one playthrough which can turn off so many people. Especially when it comes to specific
            movement like the horse jump. The excessive resets can be one big issue for most players, in which can be difficult to play
            with time pressure on them. One suggestion that might help you getting used to speedruns more quickly: Do not aim for the perfect
            route and ranks until you reach the breaking barrier. Make back up strats."}}

        <li><b>IGT:</b> Devil May Cry runs on an In-Game Timer
            which keeps track of the time you are "inside of the game", meaning whenever you are outside of the actual game, like in the RESET Menu,
        the timer will pause and resume when you are back in the game. Players commonly mention
        and check this at the end-mission screen to determine whether their segment was good or bad.</li>

        <br>
        <li><b>Save & Quit:</b> Commonly used in <a href="DMC1:AC">All Collectibles</a> category. Quitting of the game to the main menu is a efficient way to fast travel

                <li>You can refer to the main categories <a href="/DMC1#Leaderboards_&_Categories">here</a> and make your choice.</li>
                <li>Route of your choosing is up to personal preference, but generally, for beginners,
                    it is advised to try and avoid the currency tight routes (a route where you need a certain set of ranking requirements per mission).</li>
                <li>Starting with the fastest route is not always good idea, as these routes often require a high execution level and tend to be very punishing.
                    Look around the category pages and pick carefully. However, in the end, it is all about overall improvement, which you can achieve via any route.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>You must plan your movement for each room. Spamming <b>Stingers/Vortex</b> without checking the surroundings will cost you more time than you realize.</li>
                <li>Do not disable <b>Devil Trigger</b> while you are close to the door for the next room. You will lose extra runes that way.
                    Transitioning to the next room will still carry the same amount of runes and disables the devil trigger itself.</li>
                <li>There are no pre-made savefiles for this game. It is much more convenient to create your own.
                    Everyone has their method of practising as it will help you go through your route quicker..</li>
